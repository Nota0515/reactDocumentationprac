# 🔧 React Hooks Mastery Guide & Practice

Welcome to the **React Hooks Mastery** repository!  
This repo contains examples, theory, and tests for all **built-in React Hooks** along with **10 custom hooks** to strengthen your fundamentals and real-world implementation skills.

## 📚 What's Inside

### ✅ Built-in React Hooks (from most-used to least-used)
Each hook includes:
- 🔹 Simple explanation  
- 🔹 Beginner-friendly example  
- 🔹 A tricky test question (no code, only logic)  

| Hook | Importance | Summary |
|------|------------|---------|
| `useState` | ⭐ Critical | Manages state in functional components |
| `useEffect` | ⭐ Critical | Performs side effects after render |
| `useContext` | ⭐ High | Accesses context values directly |
| `useReducer` | ⭐ High | Manages complex state logic with a reducer |
| `useCallback` | ⭐ High | Memoizes functions for performance |
| `useMemo` | ⭐ High | Memoizes expensive computed values |
| `useRef` | ⭐ High | Accesses or stores mutable values without re-render |
| `useLayoutEffect` | 🟡 Medium | Fires synchronously before paint |
| `useInsertionEffect` | 🔵 Low | Injects styles before layout (rare use) |
| `useImperativeHandle` | 🔵 Low | Customizes what a ref exposes |
| `useDebugValue` | 🔵 Low | Adds debug info in React DevTools |
| `useTransition` | 🟡 Medium | Marks state updates as non-blocking |
| `useDeferredValue` | 🟡 Medium | Delays value updates for responsiveness |
| `useId` | 🔵 Low | Generates unique, stable IDs for elements |
| `useSyncExternalStore` | 🔵 Low | Subscribes to external stores safely |
| `useOptimistic` | 🔵 Low | Enables optimistic UI updates |

### 🧪 Custom Hooks (10 examples)
Each custom hook:
- ✨ Solves a real-world use case
- 📦 Uses built-in hooks internally
- ❓ Comes with a conceptual test for better understanding

Hooks included:
- `useLocalStorage`
- `useFetch`
- `usePrevious`
- `useOnClickOutside`
- `useToggle`
- `useWindowSize`
- `useDebounce`
- `useInterval`
- `useHover`

## 🏋️‍♂️ Practice Guide

1. ✅ Open any hook file inside `/components` or `/hooks`
2. 🧠 Read the theory above the function
3. 🧪 Run the component to see it in action
4. ❓ Try solving the test question inside the code comments
